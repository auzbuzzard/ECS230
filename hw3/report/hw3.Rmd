# Matrix multiplication
In this section, I report the results of the timing subroutines developed in the
source code included in the last section of this report.

## Repeated multiplications
```{r, echo=F}
library("knitr")
read_chunk("../src/hw3.R")
```

```{r READ}
```

```{r PLOT}
```


# Source code
```{r engine='bash', comment=''}
cat ../src/mmult.c
```
