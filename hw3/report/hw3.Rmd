# Matrix multiplication
In this section, I report the results of the timing subroutines developed in the
source code included in the last section of this report.

## Repeated multiplications
```{r, echo=F}
library("knitr")
read_chunk("../src/hw3.R")
```

```{r SETUP}
```

```{r PR1}
```

# Loop rearrangement
```{r PR2}
```

# Source code
```{r engine='bash', comment=''}
# cat ../src/mmult.c
# cat ../src/all_looptypes_mmult.c
# cat ../src/dgemm_mmult.c
```
