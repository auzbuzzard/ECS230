# Fitting a polynomial

```{r, echo=F}
library("knitr")
read_chunk("../src/hw4.R")
```

```{r READ, echo=F, message=F}
```

```{r GRAPH, echo=F}
```

# Coefficients of polynomials of degree 5 and 9

```{r POLY59, echo=F}
```

The coefficients of the 5th degree polynomial regression are
`r kable(p5, align="l")`
and
`r kable(p9, align="l")`

Note that
we can't fit a polynomial of degree 11 (a polynomial with constant
term, $x^1$, ..., and an $x^{10}$ term) or higher - the associated design matrix
$X$ would be rank-defficient, so the sample covariance matrix $X^\top X$ would
be non-invertible and the coefficients
$\hat{\beta}_{p\ge 11} = X(X^\top X)^{-1}X^\top Y$ non-computable.

# Quality of fit
Successively higher degree polynomials had lower L2 error; but the model with
lowest AIC and the best cross-validated LASSO model, determined by the following
and subsequent snippets, are more appropriate models than the 9th degree
polynomial.

## AIC
```{r AIC}
```

```{r, echo=F}
kable(a, align="l")
```

The lowest AIC model is that of the degree
`r a$degree[which(a$aic == min(a$aic))]`
polynomial.  The following examines the best cross-validated LASSO model.

## LASSO
```{r LASSO}
```

The best cross-validation penalty parameter is `r best.lambda` yielding the
lasso model with coefficients:

$$
\hat{\beta}_{LASSO} = `r coef(mlas.opt)[,10]`
$$

Note that this polynomial has degree 2 as well. The preceeding two analyses are
compelling evidence for the appropriateness of a linear model for this data.

# C program graphs
The following graphs are those generated by the C program using gnuplot.

# Data
The table below shows the $(x,y)$ pairs for each degree of polynomial tested.
The column "D" shows the degree of the polynomial used to fit the printed "Y"
value at the associated "X" value. Rows with "D=0" holds the input data.

```{r, echo=F}
kable(d, align="l")
```

# Source code
The following is the source used for the creation of this report. The code
handed in on the CSIF computers is slightly different from the following source.
The hand-in code conforms to the specifications of the assignment, wheras the
following source is formatted to work with the project's directory structure. No
major algorithmic changes were made.

```{r engine='bash', comment='', echo=F}
cat ../src/fit_polynomial.c
```

```{r engine='bash', comment='', echo=F}
cat ../src/hw4.R
