library("knitr")
read_chunk("../src/hw4.R")

# Source code
The following is the source used for the creation of this report. The code
handed in on the CSIF computers is slightly different from the following source.
The hand-in code conforms to the specifications of the assignment, wheras the
following source is formatted to work with the project's directory structure. No
major algorithmic changes were made.

```{r engine='bash', comment='', echo=F}
cat ../src/fit_polynomial.c
```
