# Fitting a polynomial

TODO: show the plots here

# Program graphs
The following graphs are those generated by the C program using gnuplot.

# Data
The table below shows the $(x,y)$ pairs for each degree of polynomial tested.
The column "D" shows the degree of the polynomial used to fit the printed "Y"
value at the associated "X" value. Rows with "D=0" holds the input data.

# Source code
The following is the source used for the creation of this report. The code
handed in on the CSIF computers is slightly different from the following source.
The hand-in code conforms to the specifications of the assignment, wheras the
following source is formatted to work with the project's directory structure. No
major algorithmic changes were made.

```{r engine='bash', comment='', echo=F}
cat ../src/fit_polynomial.c
```
